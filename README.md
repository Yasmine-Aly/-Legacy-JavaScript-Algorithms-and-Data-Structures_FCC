## 1- Basic JavaScript

This repository contains my journey through fundamental programming concepts in JavaScript from applying FCC Courses. I will apply what I've learned, starting with basic data structures like numbers and strings. I'll also be working with arrays, objects, functions, loops, if/else statements, and more to build interactive web pages. JavaScript, as one of the core technologies of the web alongside HTML and CSS, is supported by all modern browsers, making it an essential skill for web development.
